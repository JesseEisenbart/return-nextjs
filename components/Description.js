                        The planetâ€™s ecosystems are shutting down, natural resources are scarce, chaos and wars rage as remaining inhabitants reach for the stars.

                        After scraping up enough money for a ship, you leave behind your old life in search of a new one on the colonies. You set the ship to autopilot and prepare for cryo-sleep.

                    <p>
                        Upon waking up you discover that your ship encountered an error during flight and  the autopilot returned home for repairs. 
                        <br></br>
                        <br></br>
                        After dozens of years, the horrific storm of events that came to pass has mutated and distorted the planet beyond recognition.   
                        <br></br>
                        <br></br>
                        Your only choice to survive is to explore the surrounding landscape and collect parts to repair your ship.
